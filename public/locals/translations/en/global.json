        "title": "Challenges for a sustainable future",
        "description": "Today agriculture is facing a significant challenge: a staggering 40% of global deforestation is driven by the need to expand croplands. This alarming trend is closely tied to another pressing issueâ€”50% of crop losses result from abiotic stress. Abiotic stress, indicative of suboptimal soil and weather conditions, threatens food production on a massive scale. It places the lives of approximately 200 million people in risk of hunger in the upcoming years.",

        "description": "Our microorganisms are isolated from the roots of plants thriving in highly stressful environments. Then, a bio-training* process is implemented to improve stress resistance and crop adaptation. Following this, the microorganisms are combined with a formulation designed to enhance their shelf life and survival on seed. This microbiological product can be applied as a seed treatment. In this way, the seeds serve as a carrier for transporting our bio-trained microbes to the soil, contributing to increased plant growth and the restoration of soil biodiversity.",

Results on soybean, growing in non-optimal conditions, showed 28% of yield increase and more than 60% improvement in biomass and nodulation. Those results represent bigger and healthier plant, even in harsh conditions.",
