        "description": "Deforestation causes massive problems. 40% of it is associated to clearing land for agriculture. This happens because half of the crop losses are due to abiotic stress, which means that the soil quality is not good enough to keep producing food. This problem not only affects biodiversity, but also put 200 million people at a risk of hunger in the upcoming years.",

        "description": "We isolate microbes from the roots of plants that grow in highly stressful environments. Then, we developed a bio-training process in which we enhance stress resistance and crops adaptation. Afterwards, we combine the microbes with a formulation to improve shelf life, and we apply them as a seed coating. The seeds are the vehicle to transport the bio-trained microbes to the soil, resulting in a boost in plant growth and a recovery in soil biodiversity.",
